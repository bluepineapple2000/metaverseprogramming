# metaverseprogramming
Here is my repository for the Metverseprogramming course. It contains the general contents of week 03 and week 04.


## General :space_invader:

In this Git are all excersises of the Metaverseprgoramming course 2023. The folder structure is similar to that of the lessons. Please note that the files were all added afterwards in this gitrepostiory, because I did not work on my laptop in class and transferred the exercises with a USB stick. 

Last lesson I had the problem that my starter asstets did not work. In this git repository I had the same problem, it should be fixed by now, if there are still problems occuring I am very sorry.
